# Elasticsearch Python API
- This is the low level API, not the search (elasticsearch-dsl)
- Main use case is automating health checks and other low level functions
- There is some basic search but not a lot

## setup
- Run the Star Wars setup notebook. This will setup a few indices using the Star Wars API. Most of the examples use one of those indices  
- If you don't want to see all the print statements comment them out. The notebook has them all included so it's a good example of what you should see. It's a little verbose but I like seeing an indication something is happening  
- I use VirtualBox and run the stack on a VM. I do not use localhost but run Elasticsearch on an IP

This IS still a work in progress
