# Elasticsearch Python API
- This is the low level API, not the search (elasticsearch-dsl)
- Main use case is automating health checks and other low level functions
- There is some basic search but not a lot
API link _https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/api.html_

## setup
- Run the Star Wars setup notebook. This will setup a few indices using the Star Wars API. Most of the examples use one of those indices
- I use VirtualBox and run the stack on a VM. I do not use localhost but run Elasticsearch on an IP

This IS still a work in progress
